Issue URL: https://github.com/elastic/demos/issues/3688\n\n

The cartservice occasionally encounters storage errors due to an unreliable network connection. \n\nThe errors typically indicate a failure to connect to Redis, as seen in the error message:\n\n'Status(StatusCode=\"FailedPrecondition\", Detail=\"Can't access cart storage. \nSystem.ApplicationException: Wasn't able to connect to redis \n at cartservice.cartstore.RedisCartStore.EnsureRedisConnected() in /usr/src/app/src/cartstore/RedisCartStore.cs:line 104 \n at cartservice.cartstore.RedisCartStore.EmptyCartAsync(String userId) in /usr/src/app/src/cartstore/RedisCartStore.cs:line 168')'.\n\nI just talked to the SRE team in Slack, this is a known issue and they have plans to implement retries as a quick fix and address the network issue later.
